instructions--->ring 0:
emulating older hardware via hypervisor

The functionality of KVM itself is divided in multiple parts
The generic host kernel KVM module, which exposes the architecture-independent functionality of KVM;
the architecture-specific kernel module in the host system; 
the user-space part that emulates the virtual machine hardware that the guest operating system runs on; 
and optional guest additions that make the guest perform better on virtualized systems.
